This code is released to reproduce the results in our paper
"Learn Spatio-temporal Geometrical Configurations of Body Joints for Real Time Human Activity Recognition in Smart Environment" in IEEE THMS.

Part of the codes needs Linux OS. We recommend to run the following program in Matlab under Linux os.

1) uncompress the file to any  folder
2) to reproduce results from CAD60 database, run "TimePerformance.m" 
in relative folder "......./SkeletonVisualization"
3) to reproduce results from MSRAction3D database, run "TimePerformance.m" 
in relative folder "....../SkeletonVisualization-MSR"
4) to reproduce results from MSRAction3D database, run "TimePerformance.m" 
in relative folder "....../SkeletonVisualization-MSRDaily"
